## About

Rotation is a revolutionary approach to music consumption. Generate a playlist from any picture using AI. <br/>
Capture the nuances and inflections of your mood perfectly and display its quirks spatially. 

## Getting started

To run Rotation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine
2. Move to the repository: `cd Rotation`
3. Copy the contents of your `.env_example` file into your `.env` file, but fill in NEXT_PUBLIC [actually, maybe no env is needed if modal secrets are mentioned]
4. [TODO STEP ABOUT POETRY]

## How it works

Rotation uses CLIP, GPT-4 and Spotify seed recommendations to transform text or images into curated playlists.
