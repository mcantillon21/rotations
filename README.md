## About Rotation

Rotation is a new way to consume music. Allowing you to generate a playlist from any picture, Rotation uses AI to capture the nuances and inflections of your mood perfectly and display its quirks spatially. 

## Getting started

To run Rotation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine
2. Move to the repository: `cd Rotation`
3. Copy the contents of your `.env_example` file into your `.env` file, but fill in NEXT_PUBLIC [actually, maybe no env is needed if modal secrets are mentioned]
4. [TODO STEP ABOUT POETRY]
5. 

## How it works

Rotation uses.
